# kurskal_algorithm_using_cuda
This project implements Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithm on the GPU using CUDA. The implementation leverages Thrust library for sorting edges, atomic operations for Union-Find, and a batched approach to process edges efficiently. A CPU-based Kruskal implementation is also included for verification and benchmarking.
